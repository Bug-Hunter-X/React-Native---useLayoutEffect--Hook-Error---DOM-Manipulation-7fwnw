This error occurs when using the `useLayoutEffect` hook in React Native with a function that attempts to modify the DOM directly.  `useLayoutEffect` is designed to run after all DOM mutations, but React Native's rendering mechanism differs from web browsers, and direct DOM manipulation isn't supported in the same way.  This can lead to unpredictable behavior, rendering issues, or crashes.

```javascript
//bug.js
import React, { useLayoutEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    // Incorrect: Attempting to directly manipulate the DOM
    const element = document.getElementById('myElement');
    if (element) {
      element.style.backgroundColor = 'red';
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text id="myElement">Hello</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
